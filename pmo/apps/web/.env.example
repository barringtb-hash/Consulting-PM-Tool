# Base URL for API requests.
#
# DEVELOPMENT:
# Leave this commented out to use the Vite proxy (recommended for local development).
# The proxy automatically forwards /api requests to http://localhost:4000.
#
# PRODUCTION (Vercel):
# Set this to your Render API's public base URL, e.g.:
# VITE_API_BASE_URL="https://your-api.onrender.com/api"
#
# ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT (without proxy):
# If you need to test cross-origin requests locally, uncomment and use:
# VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:4000/api"
